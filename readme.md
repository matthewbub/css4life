# CSS 4 life

An approachable build system for creating distributable themes using postcss as a css processor. 

## Setup 

Just clone it, then install the dev dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/matthewbub/css4life
cd css4life
npm install
```

## Scripts

These are the two primary scripts you'd need in development. Check the scripts in the [package.json](./package.json) file for all available commands, or run `npm run` from the terminal.

- `npm run dev` - dev mode with hot loader
- `npm run build` - compile production code
